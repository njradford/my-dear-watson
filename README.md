MyDearWatson (Elementary Installer for Intel Chromebooks)
============
M.D.W. is a Shell script that installs Elementary Luna on an Intel based Chromebook.

It uses [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) to switch back and forth between ChromeOS and Elementary. To switch, press:
* ```ctrl + alt + shift + →``` to switch to Elementary

Starting from the esc button and going to the right, you should see a ```←``` button, then a ```→```, and then a ```↺```
